**Overall Explanation**
You are tasked with building and manipulating a graph using fundamental data structures that you must create or piece together from scratch. The setting is a complex transportation network: intersections are graph nodes and roads are edges. Your goal is to gradually develop a robust toolkit of data structures (e.g., vectors, pairs, maps) and algorithms that can handle various graph-related challenges.

The graph you’re dealing with is not trivial. It may have thousands of intersections (nodes), and each intersection can have many outgoing roads (edges). Roads could be one-way or two-way, and they may have associated properties like travel time (weights) or conditions. You’ll need to:

- Represent the graph efficiently with adjacency lists or adjacency maps.
- Handle both directed and undirected edges.
- Work with weighted edges for shortest paths.
- Possibly detect special structures like strongly connected components or perform topological sorts if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

At each challenge, you must rely on handcrafted or well-structured standard data types—no specialized graph libraries. For instance, store edges using `std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>`, utilize `std::map<int, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>>` when keyed lookups are needed, and implement graph algorithms that use `std::priority_queue`, `std::stack`, or `std::queue`. Each step should build upon the previous, pushing you to combine, optimize, and refine your data structures to handle increasing complexity.

**Challenges**

1) **Challenge 1: Basic Graph Construction**
   - **Task:** Implement a graph representation from scratch.
   - **Details:**
     - Create a node indexing system using a simple vector or map (e.g. `std::map<int, std::vector<std::pair<int,int>>>`) where keys represent nodes and the value is a list of `(neighbor, weight)` pairs.
     - Support both directed and undirected edges. For undirected edges, insert both `(u -> v)` and `(v -> u)` links. For weighted edges, ensure each pair stores `(destination, weight)`.
   - **Focus:** Use pairs to store edge endpoints and weights; use vectors or maps for adjacency lists.

2) **Challenge 2: Shortest Path Queries**
   - **Task:** Implement a shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s) using the data structure from Challenge 1.
   - **Details:**
     - Use a priority queue (`std::priority_queue`) to efficiently pick the next closest node.
     - Maintain distance arrays (e.g., `std::vector<int> dist`) and visited sets (could be `std::vector<bool>`).
     - Update distances by iterating over adjacency lists.
   - **Focus:** Integrate a priority queue with your adjacency list structure.

3) **Challenge 3: Topological Sorting & DAG Detection**
   - **Task:** Given a directed version of your graph, detect if it’s a DAG and produce a topological order if it is.
   - **Details:**
     - Implement a topological sort using a stack or queue to store nodes with no incoming edges.
     - Use in-degree arrays (`std::vector<int>` or a map if node IDs are sparse) to track how many edges point into each node.
   - **Focus:** Use stacks/queues to support the graph processing and carefully maintain in-degrees.

4) **Challenge 4: Strongly Connected Components (SCC)**
   - **Task:** Decompose the directed graph into strongly connected components using Tarjan’s or Kosaraju’s algorithm.
   - **Details:**
     - Implement recursion stacks (using a simple `std::stack<int>`) and arrays/vectors for discovery times and low links (e.g., `std::vector<int>`).
     - For Kosaraju’s, you’ll need a reversed graph structure—build it by traversing your adjacency list and reversing edges.
   - **Focus:** Master using multiple data structures (stacks, arrays, reversed adjacency lists) to find SCCs.

5) **Challenge 5: Complex Queries (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree or Maximum Flow)**
   - **Task:** Introduce a new dimension: either find a Minimum Spanning Tree (for undirected graphs) or solve a Maximum Flow problem (for directed graphs).
   - **Details:**
     - MST (Kruskal’s): Sort edges using a vector and custom comparator. Implement a Union-Find/Disjoint Set data structure from scratch using arrays or maps.
     - Max Flow (Edmond-Karp or Dinic’s): Use queues and layered graphs. Store residual networks in adjacency lists and update them dynamically.
   - **Focus:** Use advanced structures: for MST, implement Union-Find; for Max Flow, manipulate multiple adjacency lists and a queue.

---

**In Summary:**
- You start by building a versatile graph representation.
- Progress to sophisticated queries like shortest paths.
- Move on to structural properties: topological order and strongly connected components.
- Finally, handle global optimization tasks: spanning trees or network flow.

At each step, think about which data structures best suit the task—maps for quick lookups, vectors for adjacency lists, pairs for edge storage, priority queues for optimal selections, and stacks/queues for algorithmic workflows. By the end, you’ll have a deep understanding of how fundamental data structures interact to solve complex graph problems.
