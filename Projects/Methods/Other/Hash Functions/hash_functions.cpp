     * Property of the data - Hash functions have nothing to do with the hash table
     * Fast to compute - If im going to put 1000000 elements in a hash table i dont want to wait 1s to get an int back
     * If two things are "equal" should return the same hash - equal it depends if its string char comp if it i tables is about location on the heap[
     * Should always return the same value for an object every time - call the hash function i need to get the same answer based on the key
     * Possible to return different values for an object in operate runs - i ran today and tomorrow i can get different one tomorrow
     * Minimize collisions - :)
