Below is a **generalized** outline of how data structures are often introduced throughout a typical four-year Computer Science (CS) undergraduate program. Every university has a slightly different curriculum, so this is meant as a rough guide rather than a strict rule. Courses and exact content can vary, but these are common data structures and the typical semesters in which they might appear.

### **Note**
- The exact **semester** can vary: some programs merge certain topics or introduce them in different orders.
- Electives in the junior or senior year may introduce additional specialized data structures (e.g., for machine learning, computational geometry, bioinformatics, etc.).
- Each course often pairs data structure topics with relevant **algorithms** and **complexity analysis** so that students learn not just *how* to implement the structure, but also *when* and *why* to use it.
